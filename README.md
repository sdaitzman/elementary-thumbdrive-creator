Project inspired by @aroman's project at [github.com/aroman/freya-on-a-mac](https://github.com/aroman/freya-on-a-mac)

Some code inspired by Applescript created by Christopher Silvertooth - http://musings.silvertooth.us

Tested by Carter McDivvit

## Why the script needs admin privileges:
Open the app in Automator; you can inspect every line of code with your own eyes. It needs administrator privilieges to flash the thumb drive with the IMG - it uses the system-standard window for that, and the app is unable to access the password at any time.
