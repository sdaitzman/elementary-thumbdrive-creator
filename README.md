# :penguin: *buntu Thumb drive creator for Mac :penguin:

## Instructions:
1. Download elementary OS or Ubuntu from their respective websites
2. [Download](http://cl.ly/3e1q262Q2M1r/download/Make%20Elementary%20Thumb%20Drive.app.zip) this app and start it
3. Smile, having not gone anywhere near the Terminal; there is no step 3 :smile:

## If you don't trust me:
Open the app in Automator; you can inspect every line of code with your own eyes. It needs administrator privilieges to flash the thumb drive with the IMG - it uses the system-standard window for that, and the app is unable to access the password at any time.

## Credits:
Some code inspired by Applescript created by Christopher Silvertooth - http://musings.silvertooth.us
